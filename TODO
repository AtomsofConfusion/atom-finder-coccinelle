//include-headers-for-typesS
//recursive-includes and relax-include-path
with header files, it's slow, but if we are really focused on the types
then we need all of those header files
with 3 options we'd have as much information about types that we can figure

instead of expression x, we can then say

int x and it will only mathc an int and then it match  x[...]

Implicit Predicate
at the top of the patch, write @test expression@ and that should only match test expression
i || ... (match eevrything with || at the top level. e1 || e2 || e3 - if we mathc e3, we're good)
check if we are in an or-like situation

also try with non-boolean situations in test case

NOT POSSIBLE

Preprocessor in Statement
